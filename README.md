## Description

The Soccer League Database Management System is a user-friendly interactive application designed to manage a soccer league database. Built with a Java Swing, it connects to an Oracle database to facilitate various database operations like creating, populating, viewing and querying tables. Queries can be chosen from options, or custom queries can be entered using SQL syntax. This project showcases integration of frontend Java with backend SQL. All tables in the database are in BCNF to ensure minimal redundancy and anomalies in the database.
